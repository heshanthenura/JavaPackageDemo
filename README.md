### Read Below before start

* ### To proceed smoothly, ensure you have `Gradle` set up and configured for your project
* ### If Gradle isn't utilized, the process requires manually assembling a functional `JAR` file containing all essential dependencies, external JARs, as well as crucial assets and resources. This involves carefully bundling these components together to ensure the application operates seamlessly

### Make another java file to launch you JavaFX application

If your [main JavaFX application class](https://github.com/heshanthenura/JavaPackageDemo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/heshanthenura/packagedemo/MainApplication.java) is named ```MainApplication``` as seen here, create another Java file named [Launcher.java](https://github.com/heshanthenura/JavaPackageDemo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/heshanthenura/packagedemo/Launcher.java) and include the following code:
```
public class Launcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MainApplication.main(args);
    }
}
```
This [Launcher.java](https://github.com/heshanthenura/JavaPackageDemo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/heshanthenura/packagedemo/Launcher.java) file serves as an entry point to your JavaFX application

### Include the following code snippet in your [build.gradle](https://github.com/heshanthenura/JavaPackageDemo/blob/master/build.gradle) file to generate a standalone FatJar for your project

```
task customFatJar(type: Jar) {
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': 'com.heshanthenura.packagedemo.Launcher'
    }
    archiveBaseName = 'PackageDemoJAR'
    duplicatesStrategy = DuplicatesStrategy.EXCLUDE
    from { configurations.runtimeClasspath.collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) } }
    with jar
}
```

| ```task customFatJar(type: Jar)```                                                             | Defines a new task named customFatJar of type Jar, indicating that this task will generate a JAR file                                                                                                                   |
| ```manifest { attributes 'Main-Class': 'com.heshanthenura.packagedemo.Launcher' }```           | Sets the Main-Class attribute in the JAR's manifest file to point to the Launcher class, which serves as the entry point of your application                                                                            |
| ```archiveBaseName = 'PackageDemoJAR'```                                                       | Specifies the base name for the generated JAR file as ```PackageDemoJAR```                                                                                                                                              |
| ```duplicatesStrategy = DuplicatesStrategy.EXCLUDE```                                          | Handles duplicate files encountered during the JAR creation process by excluding them                                                                                                                                   |
| ```from { configurations.runtimeClasspath.collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) } }``` | Collects all dependencies from the runtime classpath and includes them in the JAR. ```configurations.runtimeClasspath``` gathers the project's runtime dependencies, and ```zipTree``` adds each dependency to the JAR. |
| ```with jar```                                                                                 | Includes the existing JAR file (if any) generated by the default ```jar``` task along with the assembled JAR containing dependencies                                                                                    |

This ```customFatJar``` task amalgamates your project's code and its dependencies into a single JAR file.Upon execution, the generated JAR file will be located in the following path: ```build/libs```
